# Project Title: Developing a Quantitative Trading Strategy for the Stock Market

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a quantitative trading strategy for the stock market. This will involve collecting and analyzing historical stock data, developing quantitative models to predict stock prices and evaluate risk, constructing a diversified portfolio of assets, and executing the trading strategy in the market.

Here are some steps you could take to complete this project:

1. Data collection: Collect historical stock data from a reliable source, such as Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage. Choose a set of stocks to analyze, such as those in the S&P 500.

2. Data analysis: Use Python or another programming language to analyze the historical stock data. Calculate metrics such as price changes, volatility, and correlation between different stocks.

3. Signal modeling: Develop quantitative models to predict stock prices and identify profitable investment opportunities. This could involve using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in the data, or developing a simple moving average crossover strategy.

4. Risk modeling: Develop quantitative models to evaluate the risk associated with specific investments. This could involve calculating metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR) or using Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the impact of different scenarios on the portfolio.

5. Portfolio construction: Use the results of the data analysis and signal and risk modeling to construct a diversified portfolio of assets. Optimize the allocation of assets in the portfolio to minimize risk and maximize returns.

6. Execution: Implement the trading strategy in the market using a paper trading account or a small amount of capital. Monitor the performance of the portfolio over time and make adjustments as needed.

7. Reporting: Document your analysis, methodology, and results in a report or presentation. Highlight the key insights you gained from the project, as well as any limitations or areas for further research.

By completing this project, you'll be able to demonstrate your skills in data analysis, signal and risk modeling, portfolio construction, and execution, as well as your ability to work with financial data and implement quantitative trading strategies. Throughout the project, you should document your analysis, methodology, and results in a report or presentation. This will allow you to showcase your skills in data analysis, modeling, portfolio construction, and execution, as well as your ability to work with financial data and implement a quantitative trading strategy.

## Getting Data

We will collect data from Yahoo Finance using a yfinance library to be able to download the historical data for given date ranges. The with SQLite3 installed on your machine and with SQLite Studio we can create databases and manage them via SQL commands. 

You can inspect your time series data using

```sql
SELECT * FROM stock_prices ORDER BY date DESC
```


We can get an idea of the daily volatility of these assets using the following SQL command

```sql
SELECT symbol, AVG((close - open) * (close - open)) - POWER(AVG(close - open), 2) AS variance
FROM stock_prices
GROUP BY symbol;
```

We can compute the daily returns of each asset by

```sql
SELECT symbol, date, (close - open) / open AS daily_return
FROM stock_prices ORDER BY date DESC;
```

You can check for row duplicates using 

```sql 
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM fast_food_stock_prices;
```
and remove row duplicates via

```sql
DELETE FROM fast_food_stock_prices
WHERE rowid NOT IN (
    SELECT MIN(rowid)
    FROM fast_food_stock_prices
    GROUP BY symbol, date
);
```


delete a row based on symbol value
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE symbol = 'BBT';
```

change a table name 
```sql
ALTER TABLE banking_prices
RENAME TO banking_stock_prices;
```



## Basket Trading
The aim of this project is to develop a basket trading algorithm along with a collection of stocks to apply it to.  


## Steps

1. Define your investment universe: The first step in creating a basket trading strategy is to define the universe of stocks you want to trade. This could be based on some set of criteria, such as all stocks in the S&P 500 or all stocks in a particular sector.

2. Select a basket of stocks: Once you have defined your investment universe, you can select a basket of stocks to trade. This could be based on some set of criteria, such as stocks with high correlation or stocks with similar market capitalization. You could also use machine learning or other statistical techniques to identify stocks that are likely to move together.

3. Develop a trading algorithm: Once you have selected your basket of stocks, you can develop a trading algorithm that determines when to enter and exit positions based on some set of criteria, such as price movements, moving averages, or other technical indicators. You could also incorporate fundamental analysis or other market data to refine your strategy.

4. Backtest your strategy: Once you have developed your trading algorithm, you can backtest it using historical price data to see how it would have performed in the past. This will help you evaluate the performance of your strategy and identify areas for improvement.

5. Implement and evaluate your strategy: Once you have backtested your strategy, you can implement it in real-time and evaluate its performance in the current market environment. You can refine your strategy based on market data and adjust your approach as needed to maximize returns and minimize risk.
