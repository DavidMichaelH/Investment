## Project Description

The goal of this project is to use Python and SQL to analyze stock data and develop a better understanding of market trends and trading strategies. The project involves downloading historical stock prices using Python, storing the data in an SQLite database, and running SQL queries to perform statistical analysis on the data.

The project is broken down into several steps, including:

- Setting up the file structure for the project and creating a Python script to download stock data.
- Populating the SQLite database with stock price data and running preliminary statistical analysis using SQL queries.
- Developing and testing machine learning algorithms to analyze market trends and inform trading strategies.
- Developing a web application to visualize the stock data and analysis results.


```cmd 
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-analysis-project.git
$ cd stock-analysis-project
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

To use the project, simply run the Python scripts in the appropriate order. The project is broken down into several steps, each of which has its own Python script and associated SQL queries.


```cmd
$ python download_data.py
$ python populate_db.py
$ python run_analysis.py
```
